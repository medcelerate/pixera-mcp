`pixera-mcp` is a self-hosted bridge that you run on your own machine or network.
It is designed to keep your data on your infrastructure.

## What data it handles

- **Pixera API traffic.** The bridge sends JSON-RPC requests to, and returns
  responses from, the **Pixera server you configure**. This is show/production
  data on your own network.
- **Configuration.** Your settings (Pixera host/port, bind addresses) are read
  from and written to a local YAML config file that you control.

## What it does not do

- It does **not** send your data to the author, to Anthropic, to OpenAI, or to
  any other third party.
- It contains **no telemetry, analytics, or tracking**.
- It only connects to the Pixera server you configure. Its MCP endpoint and
  admin console bind where you tell them to (all interfaces by default, since it
  is meant to run on a show network; set them to `127.0.0.1` to restrict to the
  local machine).

## Data retention

The bridge persists nothing beyond your local configuration file. Uninstalling
the connector or deleting your config file removes everything it retains.
